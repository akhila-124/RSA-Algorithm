# RSA-Algorithm
It is the implemention the RSA cryptographic algorithm in Python for secure message transmission.
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Key Generation : </li>
  Developed functionality to generate public and private keys as a crucial step in the RSA process.
  <li>User Interaction : </li>
  Utilized Tkinter to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction.
  <li>Message Encryption : </li>
  Enabled users to input a message and encrypt it into ciphertext using the generated public key.
  <li>Message Decryption : </li>
  Implemented the decryption process using the private key to reveal the original message.
  <li>Asymmetric Cryptography Showcase : </li>
  Demonstrated the project as a practical example of asymmetric cryptography for secure messaging.
